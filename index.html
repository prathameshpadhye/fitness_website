          Being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage
          weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and
          improve your ability to do everyday activities. Adults who sit less
          and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some
          health benefits.
        </p>
        <h1>Immediate Benefits</h1>
        <p>
          Some benefits of physical activity on brain health happen right after
          a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Benefits include
          improved thinking or cognition for children 6 to 13 years of age and
          reduced short-term feelings of anxiety for adults. Regular physical
          activity can help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills
          sharp as you age. It can also reduce your risk of depression and
          anxiety and help you sleep better.
        </p>
        <h1>Strengthen Your Bones and Muscles</h1>
        <p>
          As you age, it’s important to protect your bones, joints, and muscles
          – they support your body and help you move. Keeping bones, joints, and
          muscles healthy can help ensure that you’re able to do your daily
          activities and be physically active. Muscle-strengthening activities
          like lifting weights can help you increase or maintain your muscle
          mass and strength. This is important for older adults who experience
          reduced muscle mass and muscle strength with aging. Slowly increasing
          the amount of weight and number of repetitions you do as part of
          muscle strengthening activities will give you even more benefits, no
          matter your age.
        </p>
        <h1>Exercise can make you feel happier</h1>
        <p>
          Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of
          depression, anxiety, and stress (2Trusted Source). It produces changes
          in the parts of the brain that regulate stress and anxiety. It can
          also increase brain sensitivity to the hormones serotonin and
          norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of depression (3Trusted
          Source). Additionally, exercise can increase the production of
          endorphins, which are known to help produce positive feelings and
          reduce the perception of pain (Trusted Source3Trusted Source).
          Interestingly, it doesn’t matter how intense your workout is. It seems
          that exercise can benefit your mood no matter the intensity of the
          physical activity. In fact, in a study in 24 women diagnosed with
          depression, exercise of any intensity significantly decreased feelings
          of depression (4Trusted Source). The effects of exercise on mood are
          so powerful that choosing to exercise (or not) even makes a difference
          over short periods of time. One review of 19 studies found that active
          people who stopped exercising regularly experienced significant
          increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety, even after only a few
          weeks (5Trusted Source).
        </p>
        <h1>Exercise can reduce your risk of chronic disease</h1>
        <p>
          Lack of regular physical activity is a primary cause of chronic
          disease (24Trusted Source). Regular exercise has been shown to improve
          insulin sensitivity, heart health, and body composition. It can also
          decrease blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In contrast, a lack of
          regular exercise — even in the short term — can lead to significant
          increases in belly fat, which may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes
          and heart disease (24Trusted Source). That’s why regular physical
          activity is recommended to reduce belly fat and decrease the risk of
          developing these conditions
